IF
Let's say we are a basketball player. If a defender is guarding us closely, then we should pass. Our thought process can be represented this way in code.

boolean defenderGuarding = true;
if(defenderGuarding == true) {
    System.out.println("Pass The Ball");
}
IF-ELSE
We want to pass the ball if the defender is guarding us but what do we do if the defender isn't guarding us? If the condition is not true, we should write a block of code that will execute so that we will always have something to do whether the defender is guarding us or not.

boolean defenderGuarding = true;
if(defenderGuarding == true) {
    System.out.println("Pass The Ball");
} else {
    System.out.println("Shoot The Ball");
}
IF-ELSE IF-ELSE
We shouldn't always shoot the ball if the defender isn't guarding us. What if we are far away from the basket? In that case, instead of shooting the ball we should dribble the ball. In this case, we have three different blocks of code that we can take given a certain set of conditions. We can chain if-else if-else statements to cover all of the different scenarios. 

boolean defenderGuarding = true;
boolean closeToBasket = true;
if(defenderGuarding == true) {
    System.out.println("Pass The Ball");
} else if(closeToBasket == true) {
    System.out.println("Shoot The Ball");
} else {
    System.out.println("Dribble The Ball");
}
Note: Conditionals are not limited to just comparing booleans. You can compare other data types as well, including Strings and integers. But you have to make sure you are not comparing two completely different data types.
